What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Hello Jordan,
I feel as though, objects when explained are easy to understand but going in semi-blind made this homework challenging (despite review of given material). Defining/organizing the methods and attributes worked for me. It took alittle time but it eventually clicked. The "objectification" itself led me to some confusion. That didn't work (or atleast it mostly worked for computer.py but not resale_shop). Additionally, I understand the definition of DICT and it's use but deconstructing it into an object was challenging for me. The advice I would give someone taking this course is to not overthink things, don't panic, ask for help when nescesary, be clear on the technicality/words and be sure to be fully clear with what was asked before stressing out. I keep getting a reoccuring syntax error for the constructors where I can't find the issue. While I was able to get it together in the end, I still feel as though my knowledge on objects is too foggy to truly be effective. It should be noted that I worked with various people during TA hours to cobble this together.
